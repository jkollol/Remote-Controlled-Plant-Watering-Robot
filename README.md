Welcome to the Remote-Controlled-Plant-Watering-Robot wiki! Components:

Arduino Nano: The central microcontroller.

1 Channel Relay Module (5V): Controls the watering pump.

Bluetooth Module (HC-05): Enables remote control via Bluetooth.

L298N H-Bridge Dual Motor Driver: Powers the robot's movement.

Water Container: A plastic container for storing water.

Pipe Structure: A sturdy yet lightweight frame.

Functionality:

Remote Control: Operate the robot from your smartphone using Bluetooth.

Movement: Navigate the robot to different plants using the L298N H-Bridge and motors.

Automated Watering: The relay module activates the pump to water the plants precisely when needed.

How It Works:

Design: We built a durable frame using pipes to house all components.

Assembly: Integrated the Arduino Nano with the relay module, Bluetooth module, and motor driver.

Programming: Wrote code to process Bluetooth commands for movement and watering.

Check out the full code:

Operation: Use a mobile app to remotely control the robot, moving it to the desired plant location and activating the watering system.

Why This Project Matters (Applications) :

Innovation in Automation: A step towards smarter gardening solutions.

Practical Application: Perfect for maintaining plants, especially in large gardens or greenhouses.

Learning Experience: Enhanced our skills in robotics, programming, and teamwork.
